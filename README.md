# just-pick-one

Feeling indecisive? Let this react.js app choose for you! You can enter as many options as you like, and then click the button to have it select one for you. If you need to pick many in succession (such as picking students to read in class) you can remove options as you go by clicking them.

## TODO

- Connect to backend to enable saving/pre-loading choices
